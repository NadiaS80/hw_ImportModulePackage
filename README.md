# Educational Python Project: Modules, Packages & Imports

This is a small training project created as part of a basic Python course.  
The goal is simply to practice working with packages, modules, and the import system in a structured directory.

The project includes:
- a simple module layout (`main.py`, `application/`, `application/db/`);
- basic functions for testing the import mechanism;
- usage of Python's standard library (`datetime`);
- installation of one external package listed in `requirements.txt`.

NumPy is included only as an example of working with a third-party Python package.

This repository is not a full application — just a clean, minimal example to complete the homework task and test how Python imports work in practice.
